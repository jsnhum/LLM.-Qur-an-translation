And if it does not receive a downpour, then a drizzle is enough. And Allah is Seeing of what you do.","This verse compares the act of spending wealth in charity for the sake of pleasing Allah and strengthening one's faith to a garden that is well-irrigated and fruitful. Just as a garden on high ground benefits greatly from heavy rain by yielding abundant produce, those who spend their wealth sincerely for Allah's sake will be rewarded manifold by Him. Even if a garden on high ground only receives a light drizzle, it is still sufficient to maintain its growth. Similarly, Allah sees and appreciates the efforts and intentions behind every act of charity, whether small or large.",ومثل الذين ينفقون أموالهم ابتغاء مرضات الله وتثبيتا من أنفسهم كمثل جنة بربوة أصابها وابل فآتت أكلها ضعفين فإن لم يصبها وابل فطل والله بما تعملون بصير

Thus Allah makes clear His revelations to you, so that you may reflect.","This verse illustrates the impermanence and uncertainty of worldly blessings. Even if one is granted abundant wealth and resources, unforeseen calamities can destroy all that one has accumulated. It serves as a reminder to prioritize preparing for the eternal life in the hereafter rather than becoming attached to the fleeting pleasures and possessions of this world.",أيود أحدكم أن تكون له جنة من نخيل وأعناب تجري من تحتها الأنهار له فيها من كل الثمرات وأصابه الكبر وله ذرية ضعفاء فأصابها إعصار فيه نار فاحترقت كذلك يبين الله لكم الآيات لعلكم تتفكرون
273,2,267,"O you who have believed, spend from the good [things] which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth. And do not aim toward the defective therefrom to spend [from] while you would not take it [yourself] except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy.",This verse emphasizes the importance of giving charity from lawful and good earnings. It warns against giving from impure sources or seeking to donate from what is flawed or unlawful. It highlights the importance of sincerity in giving and reminds believers that Allah is self-sufficient and deserving of all praises.,يا أيها الذين آمنوا أنفقوا من طيبات ما كسبتم ومما أخرجنا لكم من الأرض ولا تيمموا الخبيث منه تنفقون ولستم بآخذيه إلا أن تغمضوا فيه واعلموا أن الله غني حميد
274,2,268,"Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-encompassing and knowing.","This verse highlights the contrast between the promises of Satan and the promises of Allah. Satan tries to instill fear and leads people towards immoral actions, while Allah assures forgiveness and blessings to those who turn to Him. It serves as a reminder that trusting in Allah's mercy and guidance is far more beneficial than following the temptations of Satan.",الشيطان يعدكم الفقر ويأمركم بالفحشاء والله يعدكم مغفرة منه وفضلا والله واسع عليم

And for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.","This verse emphasizes that Allah is fully aware of all the acts of charity or vows that people make. It serves as a reminder that no good deed, no matter how small, goes unnoticed by Allah. Additionally, it warns those who commit wrongdoing that they will have no supporters or helpers against the consequences of their actions.",وما أنفقتم من نفقة أو نذرتم من نذر فإن الله يعلمه وما للظالمين من أنصار
277,2,271,"If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you, and He will remove from you some of your misdeeds. And Allah, with what you do, is [fully] Acquainted.","This verse emphasizes the importance of sincerity in acts of charity. While publicizing charitable acts can inspire others to do good deeds, giving in secret, solely for the sake of pleasing Allah, carries more reward. It highlights the significance of genuine intentions and humility in fulfilling obligations towards helping those in need. Ultimately, it stresses that Allah is fully aware of our actions and intentions, and rewards accordingly.",إن تبدوا الصدقات فنعما هي وإن تخفوها وتؤتوها الفقراء فهو خير لكم ويكفر عنكم من سيئاتكم والله بما تعملون خبير
278,2,272,"Not upon you, [O Muhammad], is [responsibility for] their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills. And whatever good you spend is for yourselves, and you do not spend except seeking the countenance of Allah. And whatever good you give for loan, It will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.","This verse emphasizes that guidance ultimately comes from Allah, and it is not the Prophet Muhammad's responsibility to guide people's hearts. It also highlights the concept of selflessness in giving, stating that any good spent is ultimately for the self, as it is an investment in the Hereafter. Additionally, the verse confirms that any good done for the sake of Allah will be generously rewarded and repaid in full by Him, without injustice.",ليس عليك هداهم ولكن الله يهدي من يشاء وما تنفقوا من خير فلأنفسكم وما تنفقون إلا ابتغاء وجه الله وما تنفقوا من خير يوف إليكم وأنتم لا تظلمون
279,2,273,"For the poor who have been restricted in the way of Allah, unable to move about in the land. The ignorant person thinks they are rich because of their modesty. You can recognize them by their features; they do not ask people persistently. And whatever you spend of good, indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.","This verse emphasizes the humility and dignity of the poor who are dedicated to the path of Allah. Despite their poverty and limitations, they are perceived as rich due to their modesty and noble characteristics. They do not burden others with their needs, but carry themselves with grace. The verse also highlights that Allah is aware of the good deeds and charity that are given to help the poor, reinforcing the idea of sincerity and intention in charitable acts.",للفقراء الذين أحصروا في سبيل الله لا يستطيعون ضربا في الأرض يحسبهم الجاهل أغنياء من التعفف تعرفهم بسيماهم لا يسألون الناس إلحافا وما تنفقوا من خير فإن الله به عليم

281,2,275,"Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, 'Trade is [just] like interest.' But Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allah. But whoever returns to [dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.","This verse emphasizes the prohibition of consuming interest or usury in Islam. It describes the fate of those who engage in such prohibited transactions, comparing their inability to stand on the Day of Resurrection to one who is being afflicted by Satan. The verse distinguishes between trade, which is permitted, and interest, which is forbidden, highlighting the underlying principles of Islamic finance. Those who heed the warning and refrain from dealing in interest will be forgiven for their past actions. However, those who persist in engaging in usury are warned of the severe punishment awaiting them in the Hereafter. It serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to the ethical and just financial practices prescribed by Islam.",الذين يأكلون الربا لا يقومون إلا كما يقوم الذي يتخبطه الشيطان من المس ذلك بأنهم قالوا إنما البيع مثل الربا وأحل الله البيع وحرم الربا فمن جاءه موعظة من ربه فانتهى فله ما سلف وأمره إلى الله ومن عاد فأولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون

And Allah does not like every sinning disbeliever.,"This verse emphasizes the prohibition of dealing in interest (riba) and encourages giving in charity. It highlights that Allah dislikes those who persist in sin and disbelief.

It emphasizes the importance of staying away from any form of usury in order to maintain the purity of their faith and fulfill their commitment to Allah.,يا أيها الذين آمنوا اتقوا الله وذروا ما بقي من الربا إن كنتم مؤمنين
285,2,279,"But if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged.","This verse warns that if people persist in wrongdoing and do not repent, they will face the consequences of their actions. However, if they choose to repent and turn back to Allah, they will be forgiven and allowed to keep what they have earned rightfully.

But if the one who owes is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men, then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be too weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its specified term.

Say, ""Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Prevailing.""","This verse highlights the concept of the oneness of Allah and His absolute power. It questions the wisdom and logic behind attributing partners to Allah or believing in other deities alongside Him who have no power to benefit or harm themselves or others.

Allah uses these examples to remind believers that ultimately, those who respond to their Lord and focus on what is truly valuable and enduring will be rewarded, while those who are distracted by the temporary and superficial will have a regretful outcome.",أنزل من السماء ماء فسالت أودية بقدرها فاحتمل السيل زبدا رابيا ومما يوقدون عليه في النار ابتغاء حلية أو متاع زبد مثله كذلك يضرب الله الحق والباطل فأما الزبد فيذهب جفاء وأما ما ينفع الناس فيمكث في الأرض كذلك يضرب الله الأمثال
